# An OWNED CloudTrail for the fluidbox guardrails.
#
# The 2026-08-03 survey found an existing multi-region trail
# (`serverless_trail`, another project's, log-file validation OFF, delivering
# into that project's firehose backup bucket). We deliberately do NOT adopt or
# modify it: it belongs to a different project and could be torn down with it.
# COST NOTE, recorded honestly: the first copy of management events is free and
# that trail is consuming it — THIS trail is a second copy and bills at
# $2.00/100k management events. At this account's volume that is expected to be
# low single-digit dollars/month; the decision sheet flags it as reversible
# (docs/plans/2026-08-03-cloud-m1-decisions.md).
